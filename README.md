# Charity Donation System

## 1. Introduction

The Charity Donation System is a web-based application built using PHP and MySQL, designed to facilitate charitable organizations in managing donations and volunteers. The system consists of three main user roles: Admin, Volunteer, and Donor. Admins have full control over the system, volunteers can add or accept tasks, and donors can log in and make donations.

## 2. System Requirements

To run the Charity Donation System, you will need the following components:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or a similar web server package.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
- Internet connectivity (for remote access).

## 3. Installation

1. Download and install XAMPP from the official website.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Place the repository files in the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation directory.
4. Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.

## 4. Configuration

1. Create a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin or the command line.
2. Import the `database.sql` file into your newly created database to set up the required tables and initial data.
3. Update the database connection configuration in `config.php`:

```php
$host = "localhost"; // Your MySQL host
$user = "root"; // Your MySQL username
$password = ""; // Your MySQL password
$database = "charity_donation"; // Your MySQL database name
```
